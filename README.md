## 🏛 Background & History

### What Was Section 50-a?

**New York Civil Rights Law Section 50-a** was a state law that shielded police disciplinary records from public disclosure. Enacted in 1976, it was broadly interpreted over the decades to block almost all access to officer misconduct files — even in cases involving serious abuse or death.

For over 40 years, victims of police violence, journalists, and lawyers were routinely denied access to records that could have documented patterns of abuse.

### The Repeal

On **June 9, 2020** — in the wake of George Floyd's murder and historic protests across New York — Governor Andrew Cuomo signed the **repeal of Section 50-a** into law. For the first time, NYPD disciplinary records became subject to public disclosure under the Freedom of Information Law (FOIL).

### 50-a.org

Shortly after the repeal, **50-a.org** launched as a free, searchable public database of NYPD officer records — compiling disciplinary history, CCRB complaints, court filings, and more. It became a vital resource for accountability journalism, legal work, and civic research.

This archive exists to ensure that data is **never lost**.

---

## 🗃 What's Inside

The archive contains records related to:

- **CCRB (Civilian Complaint Review Board)** cases — allegations, findings, and outcomes
- **NYPD internal disciplinary proceedings** — charges, hearings, and penalties
- **Officer profiles** — names, shield numbers, tax IDs, ranks, and command history
- **Court filings** — NYSCEF documents linked to individual officers
- **Awards and training records** — full career histories
- **Timeframes** — records spanning the early 2000s through the mid-2020s

> **Note:** GitHub truncates directory listings at 1,000 files. The `PDFs/` folder contains **3,067+ officer subfolders** — all files are present even if not all are visible in the browser.

### PDF Folder Structure

Each officer gets their own subfolder named by their **NYPD tax ID**:

```

│   ├── disciplinary_record.pdf
│   └── ccrb_case_2019.pdf

### CSV Datasets

| File             | Contents                                                       |
| ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `officers.csv`   | Full officer roster — names, shield numbers, tax IDs, commands |

## ⚙️ How the Scraper Works

The scraper is written in **Go** and runs fully automated via GitHub Actions.

### Workflow

1. Fetches the [commands listing page](https://www.50-a.org/commands) — a directory of all NYPD units
2. Collects every unit page link
3. For each unit, collects every officer profile link
4. For each officer, extracts their **tax ID** and finds linked documents (NYSCEF court filings and DocumentCloud records)
5. Downloads each document as a PDF into a folder named by the officer's tax ID
6. Logs every downloaded URL to `downloaded.txt` to skip duplicates on future runs
7. Commits all new files to this repository automatically

### Running Locally

**Requirements:** [Go](https://golang.org/dl/) 1.21 or later

```bash
# Install dependency
go get golang.org/x/net/html

# Run the scraper
go run main.go

# Or use the shell script
bash main.sh
```

### Automated Updates

The scraper runs on a schedule via `.github/workflows/auto-update-using-golang.yml` and pushes new files directly to this repository.

**Last automated run:** `2026-03-28 18:54:36 UTC`

### Log Levels

| Level       | Meaning                                                           |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `[DEBUG]`   | Routine progress — file saves, splits, directory operations       |
| `[INFO]`    | Key workflow milestones — page visits, download starts            |
| `[WARNING]` | Skipped items that may need attention                             |
| `[ERROR]`   | Failures that skip the current item but allow the run to continue |
| `[FATAL]`   | Unrecoverable error — program exits immediately                   |

---

## 🔁 Resuming a Scrape

If the scraper is interrupted, set `startingPercentage` in `main.go` to resume from a known checkpoint without re-scraping everything from the beginning.

```go
startingPercentage = 30.0 // Resumes from "46th Precinct Field Training Unit"
```

Set to `0.0` to scrape from the very beginning.

---

## 📋 NYPD Units Reference

The full unit list contains **481 entries** across all five boroughs — precincts, detective squads, specialized divisions, and support units. Each 2.5% step covers approximately **12 units**.

## 🧠 Why Does This Matter?

The repeal of Section 50-a was a hard-won victory — the result of decades of organizing by police accountability advocates, civil rights attorneys, and families of those killed by police. The data released through 50-a.org is a direct product of that struggle.

This archive matters because:

- **Records disappear.** Websites go offline. Data gets taken down. A distributed backup ensures the records survive.
- **Patterns require data.** Individual complaints may seem isolated. Aggregated data reveals systemic problems — officers with dozens of complaints, units with disproportionate use-of-force rates, penalties that never came.
- **Accountability requires memory.** Officers move precincts, get promoted, retire. Without persistent records, history is easily rewritten.
- **Justice takes time.** Civil rights lawsuits can take years. Attorneys and advocates need stable, reliable access to historical records.

## 🚀 How to Use This Archive

### For Journalists & Researchers

Search the `CSVs/` folder for officer names, shield numbers, or complaint histories. Cross-reference `discipline.csv` with `documents.csv` to find supporting court filings in `PDFs/`.

### For Legal Professionals

PDFs are organized by officer tax ID — the same identifier used in NYPD administrative records. Use `officers.csv` to look up a tax ID by name or shield number, then navigate to `PDFs/{tax_id}/` for all associated documents.

### For Developers & Activists

The CSV datasets are structured and clean, suitable for database import, API development, or visualization. Consider building search tools, mapping interfaces, or complaint pattern dashboards.

### For Educators & Students

Use `discipline.csv` and `officers.csv` together to explore real-world questions about accountability, policy, and civic data. The dataset spans multiple mayoral administrations and police commissioners.
